The Size of the nxn grid must be entered in the first line of 'in1.txt'.
Each 1 or 0 representing the path (0 for open path 1 for blocked path),
must be inputed into the file and seperated by a single space.
The program first prints the grid that was inputed into the file 'in1.txt'.
If no paths can be taken '0' will be output.
If a 1 is at the beggining or end of the grid, it will print an error statement. 
If the file cannot be read it will throw an error as well.
